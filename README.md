# YOLO DNN Model Data for Aerial Refueling Drogue Detection

This repository contains the datasets and configuration file required to train a YOLO-based deep neural network (DNN) model specifically designed for detecting a drogue in aerial refueling scenarios.

## Folder Structure

- **`train/`**: Contains synthetic training images created by superimposing drogue images onto green screen background images. Data augmentation techniques, such as rotations, scaling, and brightness adjustments, have been applied to increase diversity and improve model robustness.
- **`valid/`**: Contains validation images generated with similar augmentation techniques as the training set, ensuring consistent validation metrics during model training.
- **`test/`**: Contains real-world aerial refueling images extracted from a video file. These images represent realistic conditions and are used to evaluate the model's performance after training.
- **`data.yaml`**: YAML configuration file that specifies paths to the training, validation, and test datasets, along with information about the class labels and number of classes.

## Usage

1. Ensure that `train/`, `valid/`, and `test/` folders are in the root directory.
2. Update the paths in `data.yaml` to correctly point to the respective folders:
   ```yaml
   train: /path/to/train
   val: /path/to/valid
   test: /path/to/test
   nc: <number_of_classes>
   names: ['drogue']
   ```
3. Use the `data.yaml` file to configure your YOLO model for training, with any YOLO framework that supports this format (e.g., YOLOv5, YOLOv8).

## Example Command for Training

If using YOLOv5, you can initiate training with:
```bash
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 50 --data data.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt
```
This will use the synthetic and real-world images specified in `data.yaml` to train and validate the model.

## Data Preparation Details

- **Training Data**: Synthetic images generated by placing drogue images onto green screen backgrounds. These images are augmented with rotation, scaling, and brightness changes to improve the model's generalization capability.
- **Testing Data**: Real aerial refueling images extracted from a video release file, representing real-world scenarios for accurate evaluation of the trained model.

## Notes

- Ensure each image in `train/`, `valid/`, and `test/` has a corresponding annotation file in YOLO format.
- Adjust `nc` (number of classes) and `names` in `data.yaml` based on the specifics of the drogue detection task.
